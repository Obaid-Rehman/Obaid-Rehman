- 👋 Hi, I’m @Obaid-Rehman and I love coding. Sounds cliché but I really do. The high you get when you've toiled away at your code, fixed magraine-inducing bugs and finally have
  an application running that doesn't end abruptly with an oft-confusing exception is quite a feeling and makes up for nights when you're fixing code in your dreams.
- 👀 I’m interested in everything because there's always an epiphany hiding in the most unusual of places. I'll pick up a Thermodynamics book one day and a Finance book the other and then
  I'll try to figure out how I would implement it in code because that truly is a fool-proof way of learning the concepts; when you can model a system's behavior and translate it to a 
  GUI.
- 🌱 My work mostly deals with the .NET stack but I've also picked up JavaScript, Java, Python and Go along the way.  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on .NET libraries and Kubernetes operators.
- 📫 You can find me on my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/obaidkhattak/)
